# WordPress Theme with Timber, Tailwind CSS, SASS, ACF, and Custom Gutenberg Blocks

This WordPress theme is built with modern web development technologies and tools to provide a flexible and efficient solution for creating websites (particularly my portfolio). 

It utilizes the Timber library for integrating the Twig templating engine with WordPress, along with Tailwind CSS for styling, SASS for enhanced CSS preprocessing, and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for customizing and managing content. 

Additionally, it incorporates custom Gutenberg blocks for an easy editing experience.
